# Stream
Fourth Project for Udacity's Android Basics Program

## Description

Project Stream was simply to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. In it's current state, it does not play music. It only serves as a possible design.

## Prerequisites

* Android SDK v24

## Specifications

* The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.
* Each activity is clearly labelled, using a TextView, such that the final purpose of such an activity is easy to understand. For instance, one screen might be labelled ‘song detail screen’ and another might be labelled ‘music library’
* Any activity that requires an external library or class not yet covered includes the name of that library or class. For instance, a payment screen might include information on how to process the payment.
* The app contains 3 to 6 activities.
* Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.
